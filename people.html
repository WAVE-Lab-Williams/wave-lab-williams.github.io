                        Dr. Wong is an Assistant Professor at Williams College in the Department of Psychology. She earned her PhD in Psychology at Yale University, and her B.A. in Cognitive Science from Johns Hopkins University (focus areas: Neuroscience & Cognitive Neurospychology). One of her <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2018/05/15/student-at-the-center-of-the-g-study/">earliest research projects</a> involved studying the cognition of reading and writing, which resulted in an inexplicable love for the letter G &mdash; but an irrational hatred of the capital letter E.

                        Neel is a junior at Williams, majoring in Psychology with a concentration in Neuroscience. He's interested in how philosophical questions can be put to the test in empirical studies, especially when it comes to the mental representation of scenes and intuitive physics. When he's not performing lab duties, you can find him working as a JA (Junior Advisor) to his first-years in the class of 2029 (43 of them!), or at Lake Onota as a member of the rowing team.

                        Eva is currently in her first year at Williams, hoping to major in Biology or Sociology with a concentration in Cognitive Science. She’s always been fascinated with language, and has recently taken an interest in the interaction between it and individuals’ internal representations of abstract concepts such as time and spatial memory. Outside of the lab, she’s active two of Williams’ amazing dance ensembles, and also works as a Science Fellow at Williamstown Elementary School.
