            <p class="intro-text">
                Please feel free to contact <span class="bold-alt1">Dr. Kim Wong</span> at <a href="mailto:kww3@williams.edu">kww3@williams.edu</a> if you are interested in joining, or of course if you have any questions about the research or the lab.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                At this time, there is <i>no</i> formal application form, so <span class="bold-alt1">just send an email</span> with a brief introduction about why you're interested.

            <div class="section-header">On Research Assistants</div>
            <p class="intro-text">
                We are <strong><u>currently seeking research assistants</u></strong>! In the lab, you will gain hands-on research experience, such as how to design behavioral experiments, code using JavaScript & Python, collect data (from adult human participants), conduct statistical analysis, and write for psychology journals/conferences.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-text">
                Students interested in joining the lab should plan to commit a <strong>minimum of an entire academic year</strong>, and will be expected to work either 6, 7, or 8 hours a week (based on the student's goals and time constraints, in discussions with Dr. Wong before officially joining the lab). Students who join the lab <strong>will be financially compensated</strong> according to Williams' student pay structure. Any student who applies to join should expect to have a conversation with Dr. Wong about their interests, and to discuss whether the lab is a good fit for them.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-text">
            Dr. Wong is committed to developing skillsets that enable students to <strong>eventually lead their own research projects</strong> over the course of several years of training.  Our lab aims to foster an <i>inclusive</i>, <i>supportive</i>, and <i>equitable</i> research environment that welcomes students from all backgrounds. Diverse perspectives strengthen research and create a richer learning environment for all. Students with disabilities are encouraged to reach out about accommodations, as Dr. Wong is dedicated to ensuring that all lab members can participate fully.
            </p>

            <div class="section-header">On Honors Thesis Students</div>
            <p class="intro-text">
                Students interested in completing an <span class="bold-alt1">honors thesis</span> advised by Dr. Wong should reach out a minimum of <span class="bold-alt1">one semester in advance</span>, so that we can determine advising fit and have ample time to discuss the potential thesis itself.

                Honors thesis students should expect consistent communication with Dr. Wong, meeting a <span class="bold-alt1">minimum of once every two weeks</span> to discuss progress on the thesis project.
