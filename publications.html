                        <p>The events that occupy our thoughts in an especially persistent way are often those that are unfinished — half-written papers, unfolded laundry, and items not yet crossed off from to-do lists. And this factor has also been emphasized in work within higher-level cognition, as in the "Zeigarnik effect": when people carry out various tasks, but some are never finished due to extrinsic interruptions, memory tends to be better for those tasks that were unfinished. But just how foundational is this sort of "unfinishedness" in mental life? Might such unfinishedness be spontaneously extracted and prioritized even in lower-level visual processing? To explore this, we had observers watch animations in which a dot moved through a maze, starting at one disc (the 'startpoint') and moving toward another disc (the 'endpoint'). We tested the fidelity of visual memory by having probes (colored squares) appear briefly along the dot's path; after the dot finished moving, observers simply had to indicate where the probes had appeared. On 'Completed' trials, the motion ended when the dot reached the endpoint, but on 'Unfinished' trials, the motion ended shortly before the dot reached the endpoint. Although this manipulation was entirely task-irrelevant, it nevertheless had a powerful influence on visual memory: observers placed probes much closer to their correct locations on Unfinished trials. This same pattern held across several different experiments, even while carefully controlling for various lower-level properties of the displays (such as the speed and duration of the dot's motion). And the effect also generalized across different types of displays (e.g. also replicating when the moving dot left a visible trace). This new type of Visual Zeigarnik Effect suggests that the unfinishedness of events is not just a matter of higher-level thought and motivation, but can also be extracted as a part of visual perception itself.</p>

                        <p>We typically think of visual perception as providing us with representations of our present local environments. But vision may also sometimes represent the causal *past*, extracting how those environments got to be that way -- as when a shape with a jagged 'bite' is represented as the full (unbitten) shape to which an event (biting) occurred. Here we suggest that this perception of 'causal history' is more prevalent than previously suspected, due to intuitive physics. In a stack of blocks (or books, or dishes), for example, gravity entails that the bottom object was placed before higher objects. Here we show that such 'historical' relationships are spontaneously extracted during passive viewing, and influence perception in surprising ways. Observers viewed a table on which a stack of two blocks appeared, (1) all at once, (2) with the bottom block appearing first, or (3) with the top appearing first -- and they simply reported on each trial whether the blocks appeared simultaneously or sequentially. We reasoned that possibility (3) might be less naturally perceived, since it violates the causal history mandated by the underlying intuitive physics. And indeed: when the bottom block appeared first, observers reliably perceived this sequential presentation; but when the top block appeared first, they were more likely to mistakenly perceive that blocks had appeared simultaneously -- as if the actual temporal offset and the gravity-inspired prior effectively cancelled out. In fact, observers were more accurate for towers built 'from the ground-up' than for actual simultaneous presentations (which were often misperceived as sequential). And these effects seemed specific to gravity-based intuitive physics, since they disappeared when the same stimuli appeared to be lying flat on the table. These results collectively show how visual processing extracts causal history as a result of intuitive physics, and how such representations influence the perception of temporal order.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wong, K. W., Shah, A. D. & Scholl, B. J.</strong> (in prep). Unconscious intuitive physics: Prioritized breakthrough into visual awareness for physically unstable block towers.</p>

                        <p>A central goal of perception and cognition is to predict how events in our local environments are likely to unfold: what is about to happen? And of course some of the most reliable ways of answering this question involve considering the regularities of physics. Accordingly, a great deal of recent research throughout cognitive science has explored the nature of 'intuitive physics'. The vast majority of this work, however, has involved higher-level reasoning, rather than seeing itself — as when people are asked to deliberate about how objects might move, in response to explicit questions ("Will it fall?"). Here, in contrast, we ask whether the apprehension of certain physical properties of scenes might also occur *unconsciously*, during simple passive viewing. Moreover, we ask whether certain physical regularities are not just processed, but also visually *prioritized* — as when a tower is about to fall. Observers viewed block towers — some stable, some unstable — defined in terms of whether they would collapse as a result of external physical forces (such as gravity) alone. We used continuous flash suppression (CFS) to render the towers initially invisible: observers viewed them monocularly through a mirror haploscope, while a dynamic Mondrian mask was presented to their other eye. We then measured how long towers took to break through this interocular suppression, as observers indicated when they became visually aware of anything other than the mask. The results were clear and striking: unstable towers broke into visual awareness faster than stable towers. And this held even while controlling for other visual properties — e.g. while contrasting pairs of stable vs. unstable towers sharing the same convex hull, and differing only in the horizontal placement of a single block. This work shows how physical instability is both detected and prioritized, not only during overt deliberation, but also in unconscious visual processing.</p>
