                It is not surprising that the human mind is capable of <span   class="bold-alt1">reasoning</span> and <span   class="bold-alt1">thinking</span> about complex properties like physics (e.g. "Will that stack of plates fall?") or navigation ability (e.g. "Can I get out of this maze?") â€” but perhaps such properties are also <b>spontaneously extracted</b> as a part of how we <b>see</b> the world in the first place?

                When vision or perception is discussed in textbooks, we find pages and pages about processing "low-level" properties such as color, orientation, or motion. But our research aims to push our understanding of visual processing, exploring how perception may <i>automatically extract</i> even traditionally "higher-level" concepts (e.g. our projects on <span   class="bold-alt1">intuitive physics</span> or <span   class="bold-alt1">unfinishedness</span>) and complex dynamic properties (e.g. our projects on <span class="bold-alt1">navigational affordances</span> or <span class="bold-alt1">causal history</span>). <a href="publications.html">Read on</a> to learn more about our research projects!
